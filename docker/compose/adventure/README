This dockerfile links up with everything, this should mean that the DB is
in Postgres and it's setup on launch.

To have the nginx exposed on the docker servers port 80 make use of the
open-ports.yml.

    docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f open-ports.yml up -d

To manually update the Postgres database,

    docker exec -it adventure_site_1 python /opt/adventure/manage.py db upgrade
