## Build

    make
    make tag

## Run

The compose file to bring up the whole environment is in compose/adventure.

Once it's up you may need to re-initialisze the database.  The system does try
to do it as it starts up, but it can come up too quickly for the database.

To setup the LDAP side run the setup_ldap.sh script in this directory.  Make
sure that you have your virtual env loaded so that it has the ldap3 library.

Note the weak hard coded passwords in the configs.  These should either be changed
directly, or you should add an extra compose file to merge in better passwords.

And the ldap_init.py has passwords too.

Obviously the whole system is insecure so passwords don't really make a difference,
if the system is available on the internet, it's a remote shell waiting to happen.
